`chaoskube` periodically kills random pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Why

Test how your system behaves under arbitrary pod failures.

## Example

Running it will kill a pod in any namespace every 10 minutes by default.

```console
$ ./chaoskube
...
INFO[0000] Targeting cluster at https://kube.you.me
INFO[0001] Killing pod kube-system/kube-dns-v20-6ikos
INFO[0601] Killing pod chaoskube/nginx-701339712-u4fr3
INFO[1201] Killing pod kube-system/kube-proxy-gke-earthcoin-pool-3-5ee87f80-n72s
INFO[1802] Killing pod chaoskube/nginx-701339712-bfh2y
INFO[2402] Killing pod kube-system/heapster-v1.2.0-1107848163-bhtcw

INFO[4203] Killing pod chaoskube/nginx-701339712-bfh2y
INFO[4804] Killing pod chaoskube/nginx-701339712-51nt8
...
```

`chaoskube` allows to filter target pods by namespaces, labels and annotations.
[See below](#filtering-targets) for details.

## How

You can install `chaoskube` with [`Helm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm). Follow [Helm's Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) and then install the `chaoskube` chart.

```
$ helm install stable/chaoskube --version 0.6.1 --set interval=1m,dryRun=false
```

Refer to [chaoskube on kubeapps.com](https://kubeapps.com/charts/stable/chaoskube) to learn how to configure it and to find other useful Helm charts.

Otherwise use the following equivalent manifest file or let it serve as an inspiration.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: chaoskube
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chaoskube
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: chaoskube
        image: quay.io/linki/chaoskube:v0.6.1
        args:
        - --interval=1m
        - --no-dry-run
```

By default `chaoskube` will be friendly and not kill anything. When you validated your target cluster you may disable dry-run mode. You can also specify a more aggressive interval and other supported flags for your deployment.

If you're running in a Kubernetes cluster and want to target the same cluster then this is all you need to do.

If you want to target a different cluster or want to run it locally specify your cluster via the `--master` flag or provide a valid kubeconfig via the `--kubeconfig` flag. By default, it uses your standard kubeconfig path in your home. That means, whatever is the current context in there will be targeted.

If you want to increase or decrease the amount of chaos change the interval between killings with the `--interval` flag. Alternatively, you can increase the number of replicas of your `chaoskube` deployment.

Remember that `chaoskube` by default kills any pod in all your namespaces, including system pods and itself.

## Filtering targets

However, you can limit the search space of `chaoskube` by providing label, annotation and namespace selectors.

```console
$ chaoskube --labels 'app=mate,chaos,stage!=production'
...
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by labels: app=mate,chaos,stage!=production
```

This selects all pods that have the label `app` set to `mate`, the label `chaos` set to anything and the label `stage` not set to `production` or unset.

You can filter target pods by namespace selector as well.

```console
$ chaoskube --namespaces 'default,testing,staging'
...
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by namespaces: default,staging,testing
```

This will filter for pods in the three namespaces `default`, `staging` and `testing`.

You can also exclude namespaces and mix and match with the label and annotation selectors.

```console
$ chaoskube \
    --labels 'app=mate,chaos,stage!=production' \
    --annotations '!scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod' \
    --namespaces '!kube-system,!production'
...
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by labels: app=mate,chaos,stage!=production
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by annotations: !scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by namespaces: !kube-system,!production
```

This further limits the search space of the above label selector by also excluding any pods in the `kube-system` and `production` namespaces as well as ignore all pods that are marked as critical.

The annotation selector can also be used to run `chaoskube` as a cluster addon and allow pods to opt-in to being terminated as you see fit. For example, you could run `chaoskube` like this:

```console
$ chaoskube --annotations 'chaos.alpha.kubernetes.io/enabled=true'
...
INFO[0000] Filtering pods by annotations: chaos.alpha.kubernetes.io/enabled=true
INFO[0000] No victim could be found. If that's surprising double-check your selectors.
```

Unless you already use that annotation somewhere, this will initially ignore all of your pods. You could then selectively opt-in individual deployments to chaos mode by annotating their pods with `chaos.alpha.kubernetes.io/enabled=true`.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        chaos.alpha.kubernetes.io/enabled: "true"
    spec:
      ...
```

## Limiting the Chaos

You can limit when chaos introduced. To turn on the feature, add the `--limit-chaos` option and the `--location` option, which requires a timezone name from the [(IANA) tz databse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). Alternatively, you can use `UTC` or `Local` as the location.
By default, this will only allow chaos to be introduced between 9:30 and 14:30, and not on Saturday or Sunday. You can also explicitly add a list of `YYYY-MM-DD`-formatted dates as "holidays". See the options chart below for more details.

## Options

| Option           | Description                                                         | Default                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `--interval`     | interval between pod terminations                                   | 10m                    |
| `--labels`       | label selector to filter pods by                                    | (matches everything)   |
| `--annotations`  | annotation selector to filter pods by                               | (matches everything)   |
| `--namespaces`   | namespace selector to filter pods by                                | (all namespaces)       |
| `--dry-run`      | don't kill pods, only log what would have been done                 | true                   |
| `--limit-chaos`  | limit chaos according to specified times/days                       | false                  |
| `--location`     | timezone from tz database, e.g "America/New_York", "UTC" or "Local" | (none)                 |
| `--off-days`     | days when chaos is to be suspended. (Or "none")                     | "Saturday,Sunday"      |
| `--chaos-hrs`    | start and end time for introducing chaos (24hr time)                | "start:9:30,end:14:30" |
| `--holidays`     | comma-separated, "YYYY-MM-DD" days to skip chaos                    | (empty list)           |
